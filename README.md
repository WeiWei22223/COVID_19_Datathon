## Answers to the concerning questions
#### By which date will the states(Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat) and districts(Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai) have less than 100 COVID-19 cases? 
From the start of the record(April 16th, 2020), all states and districts have cases over 100.

#### Estimate rate at which the virus has spread across the country?
The growth rate of the active cases are approximately 4.289%.  
The growth rate of the recovered cases are approximately 14.215%.  
The growth rate of the deceased cases are approximately 16.895%.  
Take a closer look at the rates, we can see the growth rate of deceased cases are concerning. The high growth rate of the deceased cases may suggest that people are illed heavily and died before they are recognized as infected.

#### How has the growth and the spread of the virus looked across the country since the first case?
From the first line chart in the "Growth Rate across County" tag, we can see all types of cases are increasing. Specifically, the confirmed cases are rising with an increasingly fast rate, which is concerning.

#### Make meaningful visualizations that can effectively display the current issue at hand.
We can see from the map and bar chart that the amount of active cases vary largely amoung different states and district. It could because of the population density are different or the effectiveness of testing varies amoung states and district.
